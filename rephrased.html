        <h2>About Rephrased</h2>
        <p>Rephrased is an app designed to make meeting/lectures easier by transcribing and summarizing important information or topics. As a college student who struggles with note-taking during lectures, I created this app to ease the burden and leave more time for things that are important to me without compromising my learning.</p>
